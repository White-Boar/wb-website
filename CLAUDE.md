# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**WhiteBoar** is an AI-driven digital agency homepage built with Next.js 15+, featuring modern web standards and multilingual support. This is a production-ready website implementing the business requirements outlined in `context/CONTEXT.md`.

## Development Commands

- `PORT=3783 pnpm dev` - Start development server (**ALWAYS use port 3783**)
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm lint:css` - Run Stylelint on CSS files
- `pnpm test` - Run Jest unit tests
- `pnpm test:watch` - Run Jest in watch mode
- `pnpm test:e2e` - Run Playwright e2e tests

### Port Configuration
- **CRITICAL**: Always use port 3783 for the development server
- Playwright tests are configured to run against `http://localhost:3783`
- All manual testing with Playwright MCP should use `http://localhost:3783`
- Use `PORT=3783 pnpm dev` to start the server on the correct port

## Architecture & Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 15+** with app directory and TypeScript
- **next-intl** for internationalization (EN/IT)
- **shadcn/ui** components with Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** with custom design tokens
- **Framer Motion** for animations with reduced motion support

```

## Key Implementation Details

### Design System Integration
- Uses existing `context/design-system/tokens.css` as single source of truth
- All colors, spacing, typography defined as CSS custom properties
- Tailwind config consumes design tokens via `--wb-*` variables
- Theme switching via localStorage with system preference fallback
- Framer motion for animations

### Internationalization
- Default locale: English (`/`)
- Italian: `/it` URL prefix
- All text content in `messages/en.json` and `messages/it.json`
- Server-side translations with `getTranslations()` for metadata

### Component Architecture
- Each major section is its own component file
- shadcn/ui components customized with WhiteBoar design tokens
- Framer Motion animations with `useReducedMotion()` support
- Keyboard navigation and focus management throughout

### Performance Requirements (from context/CONTEXT.md)
- Largest Contentful Paint ≤ 1.8s
- Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
- No unused JS > 50KB
- Images optimized with Next.js Image component

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG AA compliance with axe-core testing
- Keyboard navigation with `focus-visible:outline-accent`
- Proper heading hierarchy and semantic HTML
- Screen reader support with ARIA labels

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Jest + RTL)
- All components tested for rendering and user interactions
- Theme switching and language selection functionality
- Accessibility attributes and keyboard navigation
- Located in `__tests__/components/`

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Homepage loading and navigation
- Language switching (`/` ↔ `/it`)
- Theme toggle (light/dark/system)
- Pricing plan selection flow
- Performance metrics (LCP, CLS)
- Accessibility validation with axe-core
- Located in `__tests__/e2e/`

#### Playwright Best Practices
- **CRITICAL**: Always clear localStorage when using Playwright to avoid test inconsistencies
- Tests use fresh browser contexts with `storageState: undefined` in playwright.config.ts
- Use `ensureFreshOnboardingState(page)` helper to ensure clean test state
- The onboarding flow uses localStorage persistence which can cause auto-navigation to previous steps
- Always use the restart button functionality to reset state between test runs

## Important Files

- `app/[locale]/page.tsx:25` - Main homepage component assembly
- `components/Navigation.tsx:15` - Glass-morphic sticky navigation
- `components/Hero.tsx:25` - Full-viewport hero with Framer Motion
- `components/PricingTable.tsx:35` - Two-tier pricing (€40/month, €5,000+)
- `lib/i18n.ts` - Internationalization configuration
- `messages/en.json` - English translations
- `messages/it.json` - Italian translations

## Development Guidelines

- **Never use hard-coded colors** - always reference CSS custom properties
- **Maintain design token consistency** - use `--wb-*` variables only
- **Test accessibility** - run `pnpm test:e2e` before commits
- **Keep translations in sync** - update both `en.json` and `it.json`
- **Follow component patterns** - use existing shadcn/ui + design tokens approach
- **Performance first** - validate LCP and CLS requirements with tests
- **Always** - run playright MCP after making changes to the UI to ensure that the changes are as intended. Check both light and dark themes. Check mobile and desktop layouts.
- **NEVER edit .env files** - Environment variables are managed by Vercel. Only read from .env for information, never modify it. If environment variables need to be changed, inform the user to update them manually or through Vercel dashboard.

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs:
1. ESLint code quality checks
2. Jest unit tests with coverage
3. Next.js production build
4. Playwright e2e tests including performance validation
5. Accessibility testing with axe-core

The project is production-ready when it meets all requirements specified in `./context`.

## Critical Instructions for AI Agents

### ALWAYS Follow User Instructions Precisely
- **NEVER deviate** from explicit user requests without asking for permission
- **ALWAYS ask for confirmation** before changing scope or approach
- **BREAK DOWN** complex requests and confirm each part before proceeding
- **FOCUS ONLY** on the specific task requested - ignore distracting background processes
- **SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION** - when asked to validate "ALL steps", go through each step 1→2→3→4... systematically, never skip or jump around

### Phase-Based Work Instructions
- When user specifies "Phase 1 only" or specific phases, **STOP** after completing that phase
- **DO NOT** automatically proceed to subsequent phases without explicit user approval
- **DO NOT** run additional tests or processes beyond what was specifically requested

### Manual Testing with Playwright MCP
- When asked to test "end-to-end" or "all steps", use Playwright MCP to go through EVERY step sequentially
- **NEVER jump** from step 3 to step 7 - validate steps 4, 5, 6 in between
- **COMPLETE THE FULL FLOW** from start to finish when requested
- Document each step's validation results clearly
