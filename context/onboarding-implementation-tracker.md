## 🐛 Issues & Solutions Log

### **Critical Issues Resolved (January 11, 2025 QA Session)**

#### **Issue #1: Layout.tsx Build Errors**
**Error**: Multiple compilation errors preventing onboarding page load
- `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/toaster'`
- `params should be awaited before using its properties` (Next.js 15)
- Incorrect message import path (4 levels vs 3 levels up)

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed Toaster import: `import { Toaster } from 'sonner'` (was @/components/ui/toaster)
- Updated params handling: `const { locale } = await params` (Next.js 15 compatibility)
- Corrected message import: `../../../messages/${locale}.json` (was ../../../../)

**Files Modified**: `/src/app/[locale]/onboarding/layout.tsx`
**Status**: ✅ Resolved - Build successful, page loads correctly

---

#### **Issue #2: Missing Translation Keys**
**Error**: `MISSING_MESSAGE: Could not resolve 'onboarding.welcome'` (runtime error)
- Missing complete welcome section translations
- 47 translation keys needed for welcome page

### **Deployment Instructions Provided**:
1. **Manual Deployment** (Recommended):
   - Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Go to SQL Editor → New Query
   - Copy contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
   - Execute the complete schema
   - Verify with: `SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name LIKE 'onboarding_%'`

2. **CLI Deployment** (Alternative):
   ```bash
   supabase db reset --linked
   # OR apply specific migration
   supabase db push
   ```

### **Environment Configuration Status**:
**File**: `/Users/Yoav/Projects/wb/wb-website/.env.development.local`
- ✅ **Supabase URL**: `https://zgvoltfnxrdenjhbhgze.supabase.co`
- ✅ **Database Connection**: Configured with pooler
- ✅ **Service Role Key**: Available for admin operations
- ✅ **Anon Key**: Available for client operations

### **Post-Deployment Testing**:
Once schema is deployed, test with:
```bash
pnpm dev
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/en/onboarding
# Click "Start Your Website" - should redirect to step 1
```

**Expected Result**: Session creation successful, navigation to `/onboarding/step/1`
