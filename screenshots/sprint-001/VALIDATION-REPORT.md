## Welcome Page Validation

**Design Reference**: `context/Visual design/onboarding-00-welcome.png`

### ✅ Matches Design

1. **Progress Indicator**: Displays "Step 1 of 2" with 50% progress bar at the top
2. **Heading**: "Welcome to WhiteBoar" - correct text and hierarchy
3. **Subtitle**: Correct description text about the 12-step process
4. **Value Proposition Cards**: Three feature cards present:
   - Lightning Fast (with lightning icon)
   - Secure & Reliable (with lock icon)
   - AI-Powered (with bulb icon)
5. **How It Works Section**: Four-step process displayed:
   - Business Details
   - Design Preferences
   - Content & Assets
   - Review & Launch
6. **Footer Text**: "Takes approximately 10-15 minutes. Your progress is automatically saved."
7. **Next Button**: Present and functional

### ⚠️ Differences from Design

1. **Missing "What You'll Need" Section**: The design shows a "What You'll Need" section with two columns:
   - Business Information (checklist)
   - Optional Assets (checklist)
   - This section is NOT implemented in the foundation sprint

2. **Missing Navigation Header**: The design shows a full navigation bar with:
   - WhiteBoar logo
   - Restart button
   - Language selector
   - Theme toggle
   - This is simplified in the implementation (only progress bar)

3. **Missing Footer**: The design shows "© 2025 WhiteBoar" footer with "Secure & SSL Protected"
   - Not implemented in foundation sprint

4. **Layout Differences**:
   - Design shows value cards in a horizontal row
   - Implementation shows cards stacked vertically
   - This is acceptable for the foundation sprint simplification

5. **"How It Works" Process Display**:
   - Design shows 4 numbered circles connected horizontally
   - Implementation shows vertical list without visual connectors
   - Acceptable simplification for foundation sprint

6. **CTA Button**:
   - Design: Yellow "Start Your Website →" button
   - Implementation: "Next" button with arrow
   - Acceptable for foundation sprint (full CTA for later sprints)

## Thank You Page Validation

5. **"What happens next?" Section**: Present with correct heading
