## Execution Flow (sprint scope)
```
1. Load sprint goal and selected tasks
   → Sprint goal defines the value to deliver
   → Tasks are prioritized and estimated
2. Execute tasks in priority order
   → P0: Critical path - must complete for goal
   → P1: Important - significantly enhances value
   → P2: Nice to have - additional polish
3. Track progress against acceptance criteria
   → Each task has specific, measurable criteria
   → Criteria validated before marking complete
4. Update backlog status as tasks complete
   → Move from [WIP] to [Done]
   → Document any blockers or issues
5. Deliver working software at sprint end
   → All P0 tasks must be complete
   → Sprint goal must be achieved
   → Client value must be demonstrable
```
