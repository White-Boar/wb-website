- [ ] Supabase connection works
- [ ] Resend API key is valid
- [ ] Google Maps API is enabled and restricted
- [ ] Domain whiteboar.it is configured in Resend
- [ ] `.env.local` is added to `.gitignore`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Supabase Connection Failed**:
- Check if the URL and keys are correct
- Verify project is not paused
- Ensure RLS policies allow anonymous access where needed

- Verify Resend API key is active
- Check domain verification status
- Ensure from email address is verified

**Google Maps Not Loading**:
- Check API key restrictions
- Verify billing account is set up
- Ensure required APIs are enabled

**Environment Variables Not Loading**:

- Verify no syntax errors in the file

## Security Notes

1. **Never commit** `.env.local` to version control
2. **Use different keys** for development and production
3. **Restrict API keys** to specific domains in production
4. **Rotate secrets** regularly in production
5. **Monitor usage** of external services for unexpected activity

## Production Deployment

For production deployment on Vercel:

1. Add all environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to production domain
3. Ensure all services are configured for production domain
4. Test email delivery and API connections before launch
