## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08

- Q: When address autocomplete service fails or is unavailable, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Fall back silently to manual entry without showing error
- Q: How long should unpaid submissions be retained before automatic deletion or archival? ‚Üí A: 90 days from submission creation
- Q: What data protection standard should apply to stored personally identifiable information (PII)? ‚Üí A: GDPR compliance (EU standard) - encryption at rest, right to deletion
- Q: How long after payment initiation should the system continue verifying payment status on user return? ‚Üí A: 24 hours (same business day)
- Q: When offline changes conflict with server state during sync, how should conflicts be resolved? ‚Üí A: Last write wins - timestamp determines which version to keep

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A small business owner in Italy wants to get a professional website quickly and affordably. They visit WhiteBoar's website, click "Start now!", and begin a guided 13-step onboarding process that captures everything needed to create their perfect website. The system collects their business information, understands their brand, gathers design preferences, and accepts visual assets. After completing Step 12, the system submits the form data and creates a submission record. The user then proceeds to Step 13 to complete payment. Upon successful payment, the submission is updated with payment information, and the user receives confirmation that their website preview will be ready in 5 business days.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new visitor arrives at the onboarding page, **When** they complete all required fields in Step 1 (personal information), **Then** the system enables the Next button and allows progression to Step 2

2. **Given** a user enters their email in Step 1, **When** they reach Step 2, **Then** the system sends a 6-digit verification code to their email and requires verification before continuing

3. **Given** a user is midway through the onboarding (Step 6), **When** they close their browser and return later, **Then** the system restores their progress and allows them to continue from where they left off

4. **Given** a user completes Step 12 (business assets upload), **When** they click Next, **Then** the system validates all form data, creates a submission record with status "unpaid", and navigates to Step 13 (payment)

5. **Given** a user enters invalid data in any field, **When** they attempt to move to the next step, **Then** the system displays clear error messages and prevents progression until corrected

6. **Given** a user is on Step 8 (design style selection), **When** they click Back, **Then** the system saves their current selections and returns them to Step 7 with all previous data intact

7. **Given** a user uploads a logo in Step 12, **When** the upload completes, **Then** the system displays a preview thumbnail and allows them to delete and re-upload if desired

8. **Given** a user has been inactive for 7 days, **When** they try to access their session, **Then** the system expires the session and prompts them to start fresh

9. **Given** a user is on Step 13 (payment), **When** they submit valid payment information, **Then** the system processes the payment, updates the submission with payment details, sends confirmation email, and displays a thank-you page

10. **Given** a user's payment fails on Step 13, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the system displays a clear error message and allows the user to retry payment without losing the submission

11. **Given** a submission exists but payment has not been completed, **When** the user returns to their session, **Then** the system allows them to navigate directly to Step 13 to complete payment

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user enters an email that's already been used in a previous onboarding?
  ‚Üí System allows duplicate emails but creates separate sessions

- How does the system handle users who abandon at different steps?
  ‚Üí Analytics track abandonment point; session remains recoverable for 7 days

- What happens if verification code expires (10 minutes)?
  ‚Üí System notifies user and provides "Resend code" option

- How does the system prevent spam submissions?
  ‚Üí Email verification required; max 5 verification attempts with 15-minute lockout

- What happens when a user uploads files larger than the limit?
  ‚Üí System rejects upload before transmission and displays size limit message

- How does the system handle mobile users with poor connectivity?
  ‚Üí Form saves progress locally; syncs to server when connection available

- What happens when a user selects "Other" for industry?
  ‚Üí System displays an additional text field to capture custom industry

- What happens if payment fails on Step 13?
  ‚Üí System displays error message and allows retry; submission record remains with unpaid status; session stays active

- What happens if a user closes the browser during payment processing?
  ‚Üí System checks payment status on return; if succeeded, updates submission and shows thank-you page; if failed or pending, shows payment retry

- What happens if a user navigates back from Step 13 (payment) to previous steps?
  ‚Üí System prevents backward navigation from Step 13 since submission is already created; user must complete or abandon payment

- What happens to submissions that never receive payment?
  ‚Üí Submissions remain in "unpaid" status for 90 days; can be identified for follow-up; automatically deleted after 90-day retention period; session expires after 7 days but submission persists until retention limit
