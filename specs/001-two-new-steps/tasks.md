# Tasks: Add-ons Selection & Stripe Checkout Steps

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-two-new-steps/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, data-model.md, contracts/create-checkout-session.md, contracts/stripe-webhook.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are included per TDD approach specified in plan.md (constitution check confirms TDD is required).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Web app structure: Next.js 15+ with app directory
- Components: `src/components/onboarding/steps/`
- API routes: `app/api/stripe/`
- Data/types: `src/data/`, `src/types/`, `src/schemas/`
- Translations: `messages/en.json`, `messages/it.json`
- Tests: `__tests__/components/`, `__tests__/e2e/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P1): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (can run parallel with US1)
  - User Story 3 (P2): Depends on US1 and US2 completion (needs both Step 13 and Step 14)
  - User Story 4 (P3): Depends on US1 and US2 completion (needs session persistence)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories (implements independent Step 14)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Requires US1 AND US2 - Implements navigation between Steps 13 and 14
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Requires US1 AND US2 - Tests session resumption for existing functionality

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Database schema before components
- Static data before components
- API routes can be parallel with components
- Component logic before integration
- Accessibility and visual validation after component is functional

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- User Story 1 and User Story 2 can be worked on in parallel (independent steps)
- All tests within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- API routes for US2 can be developed in parallel
- Translation files can be updated in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
# T019, T020, T021, T022, T023 can run in parallel

# Launch static data and schema together after foundation:
# T008 (european-languages.ts), T009 (step13Schema), T015, T016 (translations)
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch contract tests together:
# T036 (create-checkout-session test), T037 (webhook test)

# Launch both API routes together:
# T043 (create-checkout-session route), T044 (webhook route)

# Then implement logic in each route independently
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T018) - CRITICAL blocker
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T019-T035) - Language selection
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T036-T067) - Payment processing
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both stories independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (partial MVP)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (full MVP!)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (enhanced UX)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (conversion optimization)
6. Add Polish ‚Üí Production ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (critical path)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Step 13 component)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Step 14 component + Stripe APIs)
3. Once US1 & US2 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (navigation)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (session resumption)
4. Both developers: Polish tasks in parallel

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- TDD approach: Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Run `PORT=3783 pnpm dev` for development server
- Use Stripe test mode with test cards for payment testing
- Run Playwright MCP after UI changes to validate visually
- Stripe CLI required for local webhook testing: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3783/api/stripe/webhook`

**Total Tasks**: 95
**Setup**: 4 tasks
**Foundational**: 15 tasks (added T007a for Stripe auto-invoice config)
**User Story 1**: 17 tasks (5 tests + 12 implementation)
**User Story 2**: 35 tasks (10 tests + 25 implementation, added T042a-c for error handling)
**User Story 3**: 7 tasks (2 tests + 5 implementation)
**User Story 4**: 6 tasks (2 tests + 4 implementation)
**Polish**: 11 tasks (added T081a for conversion metrics)

**Parallel Opportunities**: 46 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases
**MVP Scope**: User Stories 1 & 2 (52 tasks after foundation) = Steps 13 & 14 fully functional with comprehensive error handling
